## Laravel Skeleton
This is my **fork** of the [laravel/laravel](http://github.com/laravel/laravel) skeleton project.

The changes are minimal and includes tab to spaces conversion of the files and adaptions to make it work out of the box with my PHP dev box ([codeaken/vagrant-php](http://github.com/codeaken/vagrant-php)).

### Create project
To create a new project based on this skeleton just run the command below

    composer create-project codeaken/laravel --prefer-dist --stability dev .
